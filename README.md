# flutter_debugging_plugin

To implement platform-specific functionality like checking USB debugging, VPN status, and device rooting in a Flutter plugin, you need to create a custom Flutter plugin. This involves defining methods in Dart, implementing platform-specific code in Android (Kotlin/Java) and iOS (Swift/Objective-C), and then linking these implementations via a method channel..

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
